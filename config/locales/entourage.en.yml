        The group is complete! 🎉

        Welcome to your Good Vibes group, a space to connect simply and kindly ✨

        Your mission: chat, share, and maybe even meet up, via video or in real life?
        Here's the link for a first video call together: [Meet Link] Meet Link

        👋 Feel free to introduce yourself if you haven't already.

        🔥 And starting tomorrow... it's time for 7 days of little challenges to get to know each other and build real connections 🫶

        Let's all play along! 😉
      complete_j1: "Today's challenge: Three truths and a lie. Share three true facts about yourself and one false. Let others guess the lie!"
      complete_j2: "Today's challenge: Today in my life... Describe your day using only three emojis. Others should try to guess what happened!"
      complete_j3: "Ask the group the most interesting question you've never found a satisfying answer to. Let's see if the group can help you think it through!"
      complete_j4: "Today's challenge: Share something people wouldn't guess at first glance: a passion, a habit, a character trait..."
      complete_j5: "Today's challenge: For 24 hours, a common word is banned in the group (e.g., 'yes', 'I', 'eat'). If someone writes it... they must share a funny anecdote about themselves!"
      complete_j6: "Today's challenge: Everyone shares what helps them approach someone: a look, a place, a phrase... or an anti-shyness tip!"
      complete_j7: "Today's challenge: Share a fun upcoming event near you or online! If someone else mentions the same or a similar event, it might be the perfect time to go together (or meet online)!"
      complete_congratulations: "Congratulations to everyone for your participation! You've taken the time to share, listen, and create connections: that's already a great success 🧡

        Now, it's time for the group meeting! Whether online or in person, it's the moment to bring your exchanges to life, put faces to names, and keep the good vibes going 🤝

        Some ideas:

        - A relaxed video call, each at home (pajamas welcome 😄)
        - A coffee or an aperitif if you live nearby
        - A picnic or a shared activity if you feel like it (and if the weather allows)

        To organize easily, we've created this video link: %s
        Share your ideas, suggest a time, and above all... make yourselves at home ✨"
      complete_j21: "Hello everyone! 👋

        We hope your exchanges went well, whether in writing, via video, or in person!
        If you have any feedback to share or if something didn't go well, don't hesitate to tell us. The Entourage team is here to listen and support you, with kindness 🧡

        And if everything went well, let us know too! Your feedback helps us keep the Good Vibes alive and well.

        Thank you for your trust ✨"

      inactive_j5: "Not super comfortable with writing? No problem! You can also opt for a relaxed video call or a small coffee meetup. Let us know what suits you best!"
      inactive_j7: "The group is quiet at the moment... If we don't hear from you within 7 days, we'll let the group close gently. Thank you for being here, and who knows... see you soon somewhere!"
      happy_birthday: "The entire Papotage crew wishes %s a happy birthday! 🎉 Enjoy your day and feel free to tell us how you're celebrating!"

      user_one_year_membership: "Today, %s celebrates 1 year with us! 🎉 Thank you for being with us all this time, tell us about a memorable moment!"
      smalltalk_500_messages: "You're on fire! 🔥 500 messages already exchanged in the group, lots of chatting going on here! Shall we keep it up? Next goal: 1000 messages?"
      smalltalk_1000_messages: "Incredible, you've just reached 1000 messages exchanged! 🤯 You're officially the chat champions!"

    ethical_charter: |
      It's me again!

      At Entourage, we really care about ensuring everyone feels safe, heard, and welcomed. That's why we wrote this ethical charter, which must be read and accepted by all members of the community: https://site.entourage.social/blog/charte-ethique-entourage-local 📜.

      I am responsible for ensuring that this charter is respected on the app and during events organized by the association so that the network remains safe and welcoming for everyone. The entire community must be its guardian! We're counting on you 💪

      See you soon!
